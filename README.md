# Pyber_challenge
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)
## Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
The PyBer summary DataFrame is formatted as shown below:

## A written report for the PyBer analysis
1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of the new analysis is for creating a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type and show graphs by  a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This will help V. Isualize to make decisions about which types of cities need more driver support.

2. Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The Rural type, rides are low compare to other city type.  April was highest in the year. 
The Suburban type, ride sharing are middle range compared the other two city types and the middle of Febrary was highest ride sharing marked. 
The Urban type, ride sharing are highest compared the other tow city types and the middle of February and beginnig of March were highed ride sharing in the year. 
3. Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
The first recommendation is to provide more drivers for the middle of February which increase of using rides in the Urban area. This should be outsourced from third party since Suburban and Urban need more drivers as well.  
The second recommendation is to provide more drivers for Urban city during the middle of March and this can be solved by moving some drivers from Rual city due the decreased of rides.  
The third recommendation is to provide more drivers for Urban dnd Rural Cities during April and this can be solved by moving some drivers from Suburban city due to the decreases of rides.
